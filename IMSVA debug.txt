Debugging IMSVA Postfix

IMSVA relies on Postfix for both incoming and outgoing emails. When troubleshooting mail issues, it is recommended to enable debug mode in Postfix to get detailed logging.

1. Enable Debug Mode for Postfix

Open the Postfix configuration file:

/opt/trend/imss/postfix/etc/postfix/master.cf


Locate the line that starts with imss unix. It should look like this:

imss unix - - n - 100 smtp


Add the -v flag to make it verbose. The modified line should be:

imss unix - - n - 100 smtp -v
    -o disable_dns_lookups=yes


Note: The -v flag enables verbose logging. The disable_dns_lookups=yes option can remain as is.

2. Reload Postfix

After making changes, reload Postfix to apply the new configuration:

# postfix reload

3. View Debug Output

Once Postfix is running in debug mode, you can view the logs here:

/var/log/maillog


These logs will contain detailed information about incoming and outgoing mail processes.

4. Debugging Other Modules

Other IMSVA modules can be debugged using the IMSVA Console. The console provides additional logging and troubleshooting capabilities beyond Postfix.
